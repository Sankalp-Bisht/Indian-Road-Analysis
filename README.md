# Indian-Road-Analysis
Analysing Indian road conditions by applying techniques of computer vision to provide information about general traffic, road cracks and potholes.

I have developed this is a minor project for my college. Further information is given as->


Indian road network is by far very large and complicated. Many roads gets damage during
the rain and it is hard for the governing body to repair all of them. If the method that we
have implemented is applied at an scalable level then it can help the governing body to
prioritise which road it can repair first. This is a research cum development process.


Through our integrated model we help to find a measure for assigning priority
to roads by the management authority to reduce accident related to road
related conditions.
